# What is this repository for?

This repository stores my PowerPoint slides, lecture notes, and homework for a simple 8-session Python course. Each session is designed to last 2 hours, with roughly 1 hour of lecture and 1 hour of hands-on practice.

I teach this course to 12-15 year old students in China. The first part of the course is adapted from Dr. Chuck's amazing, CC-licensed "Python for Everybody" class, which you can find [on the Python for Everybody website](https://py4e.com/). Later classes focus on writing a simple game, and borrow from Al Sweigart's great "Making Games with Python and Pygame" which you can find [on his website, here](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/).

# FAQ

## Why do the quizzes and homeworks stop at lesson 7? 

Because I do not usually give homework after the last class. I use the last class to review what has been learned so far and give students a chance to show off the small games they have written.

## What tools do I need for the course? What platforms are supported?

When I teach the course, I use Python 3 and the PyGame library. Coding and debugging is done in Visual Studio Code. Python, PyGame, and VS Code will all work fine in Windows, Linux, and macOS so any platform the student is using should be supported. All of these tools are free, and should work on recent versions of Linux, Windows, and macOS. I have tested in Windows 10, macOS 10.14, and Ubuntu 18.04.

- Visual Studio Code can be downloaded from [the Visual Studio website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Python can be downloaded from [the python.org website](https://www.python.org/).
- Python can be installed with pip. See [the PyGame website's Getting Started guide](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) for details. 

## Why do you use .docx and .pptx instead of open standards?

I like open standards, but I want these materials to be useful to the broadest possible audience. The .pptx and .docx file formats are the de-facto standard at the moment and will open and display OK in Keynote on the Mac, in Microsoft PowerPoint, and in LibreOffice/OpenOffice.

## Do you have video recordings of your class?

No. But there are many online Python classes already. You can search through the course catalogs on sites like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/), or [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)...there are many options! In fact, Dr. Chuck's "Python For Everybody" course is already avilable as a [Coursera Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python).
