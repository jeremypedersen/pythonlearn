# What is this repository for?

This repository is a place where I can store PowerPoint slides, lecture notes, and homework for a simple 8-session Python course. Each session is designed to last 2 hours, with roughly 1 hour of lecture and 1 hour of hands-on practice.

I teach this course to 12-15 year old students in China. It is adapted from Dr. Chuck's amazing, CC-licensed "Python for Everybody" class, which you can find [here](https://py4e.com/). 

# How can I use these materials?

# FAQ

## Why do you use .docx and .pptx instead of open standards?

I like open standards, but I want these materials to be useful to the broadest possible audience. The .pptx and .docx file formats are the de-facto standard at the moment and will open and display OK in Keynote on the Mac, in Microsoft PowerPoint, and in LibreOffice/OpenOffice. 

## Do you have video recordings of your class?

No. But there are many online Python classes already which are far better than anything I could record. You can search through the course catalogs on sites like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/), or [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)...there are many options! In fact, Dr. Chuck's "Python For Everybody" course is already avilable as a [Coursera Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python).
